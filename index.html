<h2 class="subtitle has-text-light"> The heuman downfall has begun and as expected it has struck the religious institutions first. AI has gained the ability to “circulate ridiculous opinions and false data that has resulted in the voilent public debate
    and has resulted in manipulating the opinions of millions of people, to the point of endangering the very institutions that guarantee peaceful civil coexistence.</h2>
    <h2 class="subtitle has-text-light">Robots have started to control what humans eat dress or think.The rise of automation has led to creation of human pods for simple movement.You might be wondering how we used to move around, well those big limbs under your hips they were actully used to move around.We called that <b>Walking</b>
    Crazy!! right due to the biological adaptations in the human spicies primarly due to the advancments of technology your legs have no power in them. </h2>
